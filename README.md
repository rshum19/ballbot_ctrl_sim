# Ballbot Matlab Control Simulation
Matlab simulation of the CMU Ballbot

## Install 
1. Move ot the direction `ballbot_ctrl_sim`
2. Run the script `install_ballbot_sim.m`. 

## Dependencies
| Name | Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| [ballbot_viz]()   | Matlab ballbot animation and visualization tools |

## Models Available 

## Running Examples
Example simulation are stored in the direction `ballbot_ctrl_sim/examples`. You can run any script inside it and it should simulate ballbot.

If you want to simulate ballbot with your own controller I suggest creating a very similar script to the one in the examples directory. 

## Changing Model Parameters
Ballbot model parameteres are stored in  `models\get_ballbot2D_model_params.m`

Feel free to change the values in this script to match your system

## Making Your Own Controllers
To make your own conntroller you need to create a new script under the `controllers` directory the follows a similar structure
